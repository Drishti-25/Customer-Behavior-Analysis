# Data Analytics Project: Customer Behavior Analysis 

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow—from importing raw data to creating an interactive Power BI dashboard. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying using PostgreSQL, and building visual insights.
The goal is to showcase a practical data analysis pipeline and highlight skills in Python, SQL, and Business Intelligence (BI).

## Tools & Technologies:

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook 
- PostgreSQL (with SQL queries for deeper analysis)
- Power BI (interactive dashboards)

## Steps Followed:

1. Data Loading:
- Imported dataset using Pandas.
- Performed initial inspection: shape, data types, missing values.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Generated summary statistics.
- Visualized distributions, trends, and correlations.
- Identified outliers and patterns.

3. Data Cleaning:
- Handled missing values.
- Removed duplicates.
- Treated inconsistent formats and outliers.
- Created new derived columns when needed.

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL):
- Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.
- Performed queries such as:
- Aggregation and grouping
- Join
- Filtering and sorting
- Creating views or temporary tables
- Used SQL insights to validate Python findings.

5. Power BI Dashboard
- Connected PostgreSQL dataset to Power BI.
- Built interactive visuals:

The dashboard highlights key metrics, trends, and patterns that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
